# JoinTTS

Brainless concatenative text to speech.

JoinTTS is a simple off-line (on-premise) concatenative TTS nodejs API.

## Concept

The goal is to have a super simple (and performing) concatenative TTS
that joins prerecorded audio files. 
The system is suitable for applications with a small grammar 
(a limited set of sentences/words) for a semi-static speech generation.

The speech is produced by concatenating prepared audio files sources, 
for letters, words, template literals, entire phrases. 
All audio files "chunks" needed are prepared "off-line",
to be available afterward, at run-time, for fast concatenative audio generation. 

Text-to-speech output will be audio files 
or in-memory binary blobs (nodejs buffers) 
in a specific audio codec as PCM 
or [OPUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_(audio_format)).

Audio recordings could be realized in two ways:
- by real human voices (voice actors) recordings.
  This is specially useful by example in language education apps, 
  for special purposes, as syllables pronunciation.
- by a synthetic voice ( by example using Google Translate TTS)

Speech generation is language-dependent. 
JoinTTS can be configured to manage many natural languages.
See documentation: [Multi-language](doc/multilanguage.md).

Input texts could be managed as characters, words, phrases.

- Static phrases
- Character-by-character spelling
- Template literals
- Words concatenation 

Documentation: [Text tokenization](doc/tokenization.md).

The target environment is any sort of embedded system 
(local/on-premise/off-line/no-cloud), with poor CPU resources, 
but the need of a "real-time" responsive speech output.


## How it works?

### Step 1: off-line language configurations + speech files setup

Following configuration files (TODO), 
all audio files required must be produced, 
with a direct recording or a downloaded from any third party source.

Audio source files could be made in 2 different ways:

- Synthetic voices files

  Audio files are generated by any cloud-based TTS and downloaded as files. 
  A synthetic voice file can be made using any cloud-based TTS 
  as Amazon Polly, Google Cloud Platform Text-to-Speech, etc.

  joinTTS use free of charge [Google Translate Speech library](https://github.com/zlargon/google-tts).
  Using `joint` command line utility, audio files can be generated from texts:

  ```bash
  $ joint downloadtts download gt
  ```
 
- Voice-recordings

  For a personalized voice experience, 
  a voice actor can record all required audio files. TODO 

### Step 2: run-time environment

At run-time the main program call joinTTS run-time engine 
that generates on the fly audio speech files, 
concatenating available audio chunks.

See functions documentation: 
- function calls [API](doc/API.md)
- command line program usage [`jointts`](doc/CLI.md)

## Installation

1. `ffmpeg`: for audio files conversions, audio play, audio concatenations
  ```
  sudo apt install ffmpeg 
  ```
  Optionally, to use OPUS codecs:
  ```
  sudo apt install libopus0 opus-tools
  ```
  Optionally, to a nice command line tool to get info about  audio files:
  ```
  sudo apt install mediainfo
  ```

2. The package contains command line program `jointts`, 
  so you must install the npm package as global:

  - use npm package manager repo

    ```
    $ npm install -g jointts
    ```

  - or download this github repo:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/solyarisoftware/jointts
    $ cd jointts && npm link
    ``` 


## Status

WORK-IN-PROGRESS / NOT READY.

So far, the project is a proof-of-concept, 
in pre-alfa stage, with 50% of features implemented.
Smart high-level usage has to be defined.
