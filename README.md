# ConcaTTS

trivial concatenative on-premise text to speech

## Concept

A simple on-premise concatenative TTS library, exposed as a nodejs package / function.
The speech is produced by concatenating audio files sources for letters, words, entire phrases. 
Sources could be:

1. prerecorded audio files, result of a voice actor recordings
2. downloaded audio files, generated by any cloud-based TTS. 
   E.g. for free: https://github.com/zlargon/google-tts 


## Off-line phase: speech files preparation

Following a configuration, all audio files required must be produced, with a recording or a download.

## On-line phase: run-time environment

The target environment is any sort of embedded system, with scarse CPU resources, but a "real-time" responsive speech output.

### Input text: characters, words, phrases

The requirement is to have input texts as:

- List of ready done (static) phrases  
    
  Example:
  ```
  Looks like her company has three containers set to sail for tonight.
  ```

- List of ready done letters/symbols for spoken spelling of unknown words or aplhanumeric codes:
    
  Examples (alphanumeric codes):
  ```
  RAIU 690011 4 25 U1
  CSQU3054383
  ```
  BTW, above codes are container codes with format ISO6346 (see: https://github.com/solyarisoftware/iso6346).
  In this case the required spoken spelling is the concatenation of letter-by-letter speech:
    
  text: `CSQU3054383`, text to speech: `C S Q U 3 0 5 4 3 8 3`

 
- Static phrases containing also entities to be resolved at run-time
    
  Example:
  ```
  Container JL1349-76 has been cleared for pick-up.
  ```
  in the example the entity is a container code as a `{alphanumeric_code}`:
  ```
  Container {alphanumeric_code} has been cleared for pick-up.
  ```
  
- Phrases built concatenating words and or letters (that's the general case).


### Caching

To speedup performances, a caching could improve elapsed times. 


### API 

Output as: 
  - an audio file, uncompressed (.wav) or in a compressed format (.ogg)
  - a memory buffer in a specified format
  
```
/**
 * concatts 
 *
 * @param {String} text
 * @param {String} format (wav/ogg/etc.)
 * @return {String} filename
 *
 * or
 * @return {buffer}  
 */
```

Example:
```
const buffer = concatts('Container JL1349-76 has been cleared for pick-up.', 'ogg')
```
